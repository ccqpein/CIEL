# CIEL's custom REPL

CIEL's REPL is more user friendly than the default SBCL one. In particular:

-  it has readline capabilities, meaning that the arrow keys work by default (wouhou!) and there is a persistent history, like in any shell.
-  it has **multiline input**.
-  it has **TAB completion**.
-  it handles errors gracefully: you are not dropped into the debugger and its sub-REPL, you simply see the error message.
-  it has optional **syntax highlighting**.

- it has a **shell pass-through**: try `!ls` (available in the `ciel-user` package)
  - it runs **interactive commands**: try `!htop`, `!vim test.lisp`, `!emacsclient test.lisp` or `!env FOO=BAR sudo -i powertop`.
- it has a quick **edit and load file** command: calling `%edit file.lisp` will open the file with the editor of the EDITOR environment variable. When you close it, the file is loaded and evaluated.

-  it defines more **helper commands**:

``` txt
%help => Prints this general help message
%doc => Prints the available documentation for this symbol
%? => Gets help on a symbol <sym>: :? str
%w => Writes the current session to a file <filename>
%d => Dumps the disassembly of a symbol <sym>
%t => Prints the type of an expression <expr>
%q => Ends the session.
```

Our REPL is adapted from [sbcli](https://github.com/hellerve/sbcli). See also [cl-repl](https://github.com/koji-kojiro/cl-repl/), that has an interactive debugger.

> Note: a shell interface doesn't replace a good development environment. See this [list of editors for Common Lisp](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/editor-support.html): Emacs, Vim, Atom, VSCode, SublimeText, Jupyter Notebooks and more.

## Quick documentation lookup

The documentation for a symbol is available with `%doc` and also by
appending a "?" after a function name:

```
ciel-user> %doc dict
;; or:
ciel-user> (dict ?
```

## Shell pass-through

Use `!` to send a shell command:

```
!ls
Makefile
README.org
repl.lisp
repl-utils.lisp
src
...

!pwd
/home/vindarel/projets/ciel
```

Use square brackets `[...]` to write a shell script, and use `$` inside it to escape to lisp:

```lisp
(dotimes (i 7) (princ [echo ?i]))
```

The result is concatenated into a string and printed on stdout.

This feature is only available by default in CIEL's REPL, not on the
CIEL-USER package. To enable it yourself, do:

      (ciel:enable-shell-passthrough)

But, some programs are **visual**, or interactive, because they have an ncurses or similar interface. They need
to be run in their own terminal window. CIEL recognizes a few (`vim`,
`htop`, `man`â€¦ see `*visual-commands*`) and runs them in the first terminal emulator found on
the system: `terminator`, `xterm`, `gnome-terminal`, Emacs' `vterm` (with emacsclient) or your own.

So, you can run a command similar to this one:

    ENV=env sudo htop

and it will open in a new terminal (hint: a visual command doesn't require the `!` prefix).

To use your terminal emulator of choice, do:

    (push "myterminal" *visual-terminal-emulator-choices*)

> Note: this feature is experimental.

> Note: we encourage our users to use Emacs rather than a terminal!

We use the [Clesh](https://github.com/Neronus/clesh) library for the `!` shell passthrough.

See also [SHCL](https://github.com/bradleyjensen/shcl) for a more unholy union of posix-shell and Common Lisp.


## Syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting is off by default. To enable it, install [pygments](https://pygments.org/) and add this in your `~/.cielrc`:

```lisp
(in-package :sbcli)
(setf *syntax-highlighting* t)

;; and, optionally:
;; (setf *pygmentize* "/path/to/pygmentize")
;; (setf *pygmentize-options* (list "-s" "-l" "lisp"))
```

You can also switch it on and off from the REPL:

```lisp
(setf sbcli:*syntax-highlighting* t)
```

## Friendly lisp-critic

The `%lisp-critic` helper command toggles on and off the
[lisp-critic](https://github.com/g000001/lisp-critic). The Lisp Critic
scans your code for instances of bad Lisp programming practice. For
example, when it sees the following function:


~~~lisp
(critique
   (defun count-a (lst)
     (setq n 0)
     (dolist (x lst)
       (if (equal x 'a)
         (setq n (+ n 1))))
     n))
~~~

the lisp-critic gives you these advices:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------

SETS-GLOBALS: GLOBALS!! Don't use global variables, i.e., N
----------------------------------------------------------------------

DOLIST-SETF: Don't use SETQ inside DOLIST to accumulate values for N.
Use DO. Make N a DO variable and don't use SETQ etc at all.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

USE-EQL: Unless something special is going on, use EQL, not EQUAL.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

X-PLUS-1: Don't use (+ N 1), use (1+ N) for its value or (INCF N) to
change N, whichever is appropriate here.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
; in: DEFUN COUNT-A
;     (SETQ CIEL-USER::N 0)
;
; caught WARNING:
;   undefined variable: N
;
; compilation unit finished
;   Undefined variable:
;     N
;   caught 1 WARNING condition
=> COUNT-A
```

## Quick edit & load a file

Use `%edit file.lisp`.

This will open the file with the editor of the EDITOR environment variable. When you
close it, the file is loaded and evaluated. If you defined functions, you can try them in the REPL.

It is a quick way to write lisp code and have fast feedback. It's nice
to use to tinker with code, to write small throw-away
programs. However, this doesn't replace a true editor setup!

We use [magic-ed](https://github.com/sanel/magic-ed). You can also call it manually with `(magic-ed "file.lisp")`, and give it a couple arguments:

- `:eval nil`: don't evaluate the file when you close it.
- `:output :string`: output the file content as a string.
